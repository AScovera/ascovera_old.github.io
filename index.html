<h3>EECS 494 Project 1: The Legend of Zelda</h3>
<a href="WebBuild/webbuild.html" class="button">Play the Game</a>
<p>My Contributions: I implemented the wepons used by both Link and the enemies. I also worked on the movement, health, and other aspects of the entities. I added and assigned the sound effects to the appropriate times. I also spent time making the sprites of the enemies and other objects looked good and accurate. I assisted in the implementatino of the custom mechanic. Finally, I did some general debugging.</p>

<h3>EECS 494 Project 2: Gravity Bike</h3>
<a href="webbuild_gb/webbuild_gb.html" class="button">Play the Game</a>
<p>My Contributions: I created this entire game. The purpose of this porject was to create a game around a unique and novel game mechanic. For my game mechanic, I chose a bike racing game with a gravity shift component. I then created 10 levels to show off the different things that can be done with this concept.</p>
<p>Tools: Unity, C#, Photoshop</p>
<h3>EECS 494 Project 3: SUB-MERGED CONFLICTS</h3>
<a href="https://amongnight.itch.io/sub-merged-conflicts" class="button">Play the Game</a>
<p>My Contributions: I worked on this porject as part of a team of 4 over 6 weeks. I focused mainly on enemies and sounds, among other things. I developed the bahvior of the enemies to provide challeneging expreince for the player. The sword fish dashes and sticks to the sub, while the turtle and puffer fish stay back and launch projectiles.</p>
